# Angular-Client-Side-App
To run this without installing packages : https://web422-assign6.herokuapp.com/home
Please! wait for it to fetch data as sometimes servers of Heroku will be busy.
This application uses a  back end RESTful API to access data which is then rendered into bootstrap 3 tables.
Uses tempelate from Tempelate Garden but is heavly edited by me to make it responsive so that it can be run on different screen size and devices.
Built using Angular 5
